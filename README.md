Symbol Table is a program that portrays a stack of scopes, typically used by a
compiler to keep track of symbols in a program for things such as functions, variables,
types, etc.  In most programming languages, you "enter scope" when you 
see {, and "exit scope" when you see the corresponding }. This program utilizes inheritance, 
object handlers, and polymorphism. The program itself runs on a stack data structure and executes 
code in the order from top to bottom, with the most current code being executed on top of the 
stack and then popped.
